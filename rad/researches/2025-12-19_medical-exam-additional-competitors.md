| **Funding Status** | Bootstrapped (no external funding) |
| **Team Size** | 2-10 employees |
| **Company Classification** | 85421 - First-degree level higher education |

**Founding Story:**
About 15 years ago, Dr. Lewis Potter was a fourth-year medical student at Newcastle University, learning how to examine patients and perform basic medical procedures. Frustrated that "online medical education was a bit rubbish," he bought a video camera and convinced two friends to record a mock heart and lung examination, posting it on YouTube. The problem in med school was getting one demonstration in real time with a senior doctor, then being left to practice with each other. Coming up empty when searching for relevant educational resources, he started Geeky Medics as a side project.

- Dr. Potter obtained his medical degree from Newcastle University in 2012
- Between completing foundation years and becoming a GP trainee, he developed Geeky Medics
- NHS Clinical Entrepreneurship Fellow in 2016
