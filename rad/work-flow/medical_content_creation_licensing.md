## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research examines how medical exam preparation platforms in the UK create, license, and manage educational content. Key findings reveal that successful platforms rely on practicing physicians with specialty training as question authors, with rigorous peer review processes. Copyright protection for exam questions is legally established, requiring original content creation rather than adaptation. GDPR compliance requires anonymized patient data for case-based questions. Startup costs for building a quality question bank range from 50,000 to 200,000 GBP for an MVP, with timelines of 6-18 months depending on scope.

### 1.2 Official Examination Bodies: MRCP(UK) Process

The [Federation of Royal Colleges of Physicians](https://mrcpuk.org/about-us/how-we-make-quality-exam/processes) provides the gold standard for UK medical exam question creation:

**Scale of Operation:**
- More than **2,000 physicians** involved annually

---

## 2. Licensing and Legal Considerations

### 2.1 Intellectual Property for Medical Questions

#### Copyright Protection Established

Legal precedent strongly supports copyright protection for exam questions:

**Key Cases:**
- *Educational Testing Services v. Katzman* - SAT questions protected by copyright
- *Educational Testing Services v. Simon* - Court held that "verbatim copying of questions contained in a test was not necessary for a finding of copyright infringement"

**Derivative Works Warning:**
According to [Avvo Legal Answers](https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/want-to-avoid-copyright-infringement-in-re-creatin-1011064.html):
> "Changing a few words or flipping answer choice orders is deemed a 'derivative work,' the making of which is an exclusive right of a copyright owner."

**Potential Damages:**
Students (and by extension, commercial entities) can be liable for **up to $150,000 in statutory damages** plus attorney fees for copyright infringement when distributing exam questions.

**Key Implications for Startups:**
1. Cannot adapt questions from existing platforms
2. Cannot use recalled exam questions without permission
3. Must create original content from scratch
4. Government exam questions (US) may be public domain, but UK/private exams are protected

### 2.2 Clinical Image Copyright

The [Royal College of Radiologists](https://www.rcr.ac.uk/cpd-and-events/events-webinars/event-guidance/guidance-for-speakers-event-organisers/use-of-copyrighted-material/) provides specific UK guidance:

**Permissible Use:**
- Patient images created in your workplace if **fully anonymized**
- Must remove: name, DOB, NHS/hospital number, hospital name, doctor's name from metadata
- Check publishing agreements if previously published

**Restrictions:**
- Images from internet or print publications require **prior permission**
- Published journal images may have transferred copyright
- Fair dealing exception does NOT cover posting to websites or commercial use

**Copyright Ownership Complexity:**
Medical images may be owned by:
- Radiology technician
- Radiologist
- Consulting physician
- Physician group
- Hospital
- Or combination thereof

Analysis must consider specific employment contracts and jurisdiction.

### 2.3 GDPR Considerations for Case-Based Questions

The [GMC Guidance on Disclosing for Education and Training](https://www.gmc-uk.org/professional-standards/the-professional-standards/confidentiality---disclosing-for-education-and-training-purposes/disclosing-for-education-and-training-purposes) outlines key requirements:

**Anonymized Information Preferred:**
> "If the medical professional or student is not providing or supporting the patient's care, anonymised information should be used for education and training purposes whenever practicable."

**When Anonymization Isn't Practical:**
- Seek patient's **explicit consent** before disclosure
- If consent not practicable, may use potentially identifiable information if:
  - Record kept securely
  - Managed per data protection requirements
  - Remove as many identifiers as possible

**Key GDPR Distinctions:**
| Data Type | GDPR Status | Requirements |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Anonymized | Outside GDPR scope | Free to use |
| Pseudonymized | Still personal data | GDPR applies |
| Identifiable | Full GDPR protection | Explicit consent required |

**Section 251 Support:**
For medical research or health service planning where consent isn't practicable, approval can be sought from the Health Research Authority under the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002.

### 2.4 GMC Guidelines on Educational Content

The [GMC Standards](https://www.gmc-uk.org/education/standards-guidance-and-curricula/guidance) relevant to educational content:

- **Achieving Good Medical Practice** (2024 update): Sets professional standards
- **Outcomes for Graduates**: Knowledge, skills, behaviors required for provisional registration
- **Medical Licensing Assessment (MLA)**: All UK graduates from 2024-25 onwards must take this
- **Promoting Excellence**: Standards for medical schools and training providers

**Educational Content Must:**
1. Align with current GMC curricula
2. Support patient safety
3. Maintain confidentiality
4. Reflect current evidence-based practice
